### About Solana Network

Solana empowers builders to unlock human and economic potential. It combines a powerful, decentralized blockchain network with a global ecosystem of innovators to create opportunities as borderless as ideas. It offers the tools to make a difference in the real world through new digital asset products and services that enhance access to the global financial system.

**Introduction**
QSTN provides a decentralized solution for businesses to fund surveys using smart contracts on the Solana blockchain. This guide explains how to set up, deploy, and interact with the QSTN survey smart contracts.

**Prerequisites**
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

Rust: The smart contracts are written in Rust. You need to have Rust installed on your system. You can download it from here.
Solana CLI: Install the Solana command line tools. Follow the instructions here.
Node.js and NPM: Required for running the frontend example. Install it from here.

**Installation**
Clone the repository and navigate to the contracts directory:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/QSTN-US/Solana-QSTN-v2.git
cd Solana-QSTN-v2/CONTRACTS/qstn-survey-native

**Contract Overview**
This repository contains smart contracts designed for creating and funding surveys. Key components include:

survey_contract.rs: Main contract for creating and managing surveys.
funding_contract.rs: Handles the funding mechanism for surveys.
survey_contract.rs
The survey_contract.rs contract allows users to create surveys, respond to them, and manage survey data. Key functions include:

create_survey(ctx: Context<CreateSurvey>, title: String, description: String)
respond_to_survey(ctx: Context<RespondToSurvey>, survey_id: u64, response: String)
funding_contract.rs
The funding_contract.rs contract allows businesses to fund surveys and manage their funding pools. Key functions include:

fund_survey(ctx: Context<FundSurvey>, survey_id: u64, amount: u64)

**Deploying the Contracts**
Follow these steps to deploy the contracts on the Solana blockchain:

Compile the Contracts:

bash
Copy code
cargo build-bpf
Deploy the Contracts:

Use the Solana CLI to deploy the contracts. Replace PATH_TO_PROGRAM with the path to your compiled program.

bash
Copy code
solana program deploy target/deploy/survey_contract.so
solana program deploy target/deploy/funding_contract.so
Initialize the Contracts:

After deployment, initialize the contracts using the provided scripts or manually via the Solana CLI.

bash
Copy code
solana program invoke ...

**Using the Contracts**
Creating a Survey
Call the create_survey function on the survey_contract.rs contract to create a new survey.

rust
Copy code
pub fn create_survey(ctx: Context<CreateSurvey>, title: String, description: String) -> ProgramResult {
    // Implementation
}
Funding a Survey
Use the fund_survey function on the funding_contract.rs contract to fund an existing survey.

rust
Copy code
pub fn fund_survey(ctx: Context<FundSurvey>, survey_id: u64, amount: u64) -> ProgramResult {
    // Implementation
}
Responding to a Survey
Participants can respond to surveys using the respond_to_survey function on the survey_contract.rs contract.

rust
Copy code
pub fn respond_to_survey(ctx: Context<RespondToSurvey>, survey_id: u64, response: String) -> ProgramResult {
    // Implementation
}

**Examples**
Creating and Funding a Survey
Hereâ€™s an example of creating and funding a survey using the Rust SDK:

Create Survey:

rust
Copy code
let survey_id = survey_contract::create_survey(ctx, "Survey Title".to_string(), "Survey Description".to_string())?;
Fund Survey:

rust
Copy code
funding_contract::fund_survey(ctx, survey_id, 100)?;
Respond to Survey:

rust
Copy code
survey_contract::respond_to_survey(ctx, survey_id, "Survey Response".to_string())?;
